In general, if there is a template for a specific page (archive) type, for example <code>image.php</code> for image attachment display, then Genesis & WordPress will always use that first for the content output AS LONG AS there is an layout setting function or filter in there. Only if there are no templates with layout settings found, the layout option settings will take full effect. So, if our example <code>image.php</code> has a layout filter set in this then has the higher priority but if there is no layout filter in there then the layout setting of the plugin will take effect! - Well, if you experience such cases just leave these fields on \"Genesis Default\" and you are good to go :-)."
