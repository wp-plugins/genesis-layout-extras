The plugin has been tested with WordPress branches 3.4+ and before with 3.2+, 3.3+ without any issues. It also works within Multisite installs - single activated and also network activated. Running with latest versions of Genesis and WordPress is always recommended.

Credit where credit is due: This plugin here is based on the work of WPChildThemes for the great "Genesis Layout Manager" plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `genesis-layout-extras` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory -- or just upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In your left-hand "Genesis Theme Settings" menu go to "Layout Extras", setup your default layouts and you're good to go :).
4. General usage: Set layout options DIFFERENT from the Genesis default *for special sections*.

= Choose from one of the following layouts =
* Genesis Default (your default setting from Genesis Theme settings)
* Content-Sidebar
* Sidebar-Content
* Content-Sidebar-Sidebar
* Sidebar-Sidebar-Content
* Sidebar-Content-Sidebar
* Full Width Content

**Note:** This plugin has been tested with WordPress branches 3.4+ and also before with 3.2+, 3.3+ without any issues. It also works within Multisite installs - single activated and network activated, too. Remember, running with latest versions of Genesis and WordPress is *always* recommended.

**Also Note:** Installed/active Genesis Framework, version 1.8 or higher (1.8.2+ recommended!), is *required* for this plugin in order to work!

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/genesis-layout-extras/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `genesis-layout-extras-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= You can modify the layout of the plugin's AgentPress Listings post type. What does this mean? =
Nothing spectacular, you just can set the layout option for the archive pages of the "listings" post type, plus for all terms of its built-in "features" taxonomy. - Of course, the plugin (and so the setting in there) could be used with the AgentPress child theme and also with any other Genesis child theme, so this setting might come in really handy ;-).

= I noticed that some settings have no effect at all, what happens here? =
This has to do with priorities. In general, if there's a template for a specific page (archive) type, for example `image.php` for image attachment display, then Genesis & WordPress will always use that first for the content output AS LONG AS there's an layout setting function or filter in there. Only if there are no templates with layout settings found, the layout option settings will take full effect. So, if our example `image.php` has a layout filter set in this then has the higher priority but if there's no layout filter in there then the plugin's layout setting will take effect! - Well, if you experience such cases just leave these fields on "Genesis Default" and you're good to go :-). (You might call that a limitation of the plugin or whatever but that's the intended behavior of WordPress & Genesis.)

= With my child theme some of the layout options have no effect, what happens here? =
This is the case when a child theme doesn't support one or more specific layout options. For example: When a child has unregistered the layout option "Sidebar-Sidebar-Content" then the plugin setting of "Sidebar-Sidebar-Content" will have no effect at all. This is absolutely logical behavior because the plugin can only set options which are supported by the active child theme. (You can call that a limitation of the plugin or whatever but that's the behavior as of now. You could change your child theme or just re-register the specific layout option you want in your child theme.)

= What means Reset of settings? =
Actually it just restores the default layout setting which is always defined in regular layout settings on the Genesis Theme Settings page.

= Which settings are effected when doing a reset? =
**ALL** available options are resetted to their defaults!
So if you for example only want to reset *one* option and leave all other as they are then only change this one section and then click the SAVE button and you're done.

= Is this plugin Multisite compatible? =
Yes, it is! :) Works really fine in Multisite invironment - here I just recommend to activate on a per site basis so to load things only where and when needed.

= In Multisite, could I "network enable" this plugin? =
Yes, you could. -- Still, a per site use is recommended.

== Additional Info ==
**Security:** The plugin uses the Genesis Sanitization class for checking and filtering all custom inputs. Further, the plugin uses WordPress and Genesis Framework APIs and coding standards to the highest possible extend. Just to make sure you get a quality, future-proof product.

**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** I had liked the general approach of the former plugin (I forked from) - which provided a simple and great way to set a few needed options. Since it seemed no longer to be developed and updated I just decided to make a fork of it and add some additional functionality like setting the layout setting for the (awesome!) bbPress 2.x forum plugin in Genesis. And, I wanted this all on an extra options page, divided from the general Genesis settings because that is much more user friendly IMHO. In addition I added full inline documentation including the contextual help function provided by WordPress itself to create a more seamless user experience.
